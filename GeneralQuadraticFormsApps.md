We need a receiver (phone/laptop) with multiple antenna. In power saving mode, it would apply SC and the access point is applying MRC. Under the condition of correlation of receive antennas, the marginals would not be chi-squares. 

## Example Phones
- Samsung Galaxy S7/+ S8/+
- Samsung Galaxy Note 7/8
- Samsung S8 Active
= LG V30
- Pixel 2/XL
- Motorola Moto Z2
