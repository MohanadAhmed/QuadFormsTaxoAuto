## Notes on Hemachandra's thesis
1. We can think of Khammassi as a generalization of Beaulieu and Hemachandra's one-factorial Rayleigh.
2. We need to check if we can rederive their integral from Royen 1991 gamma. It would have been nice to prove that this new result is somehow old. Actullay, Royen's result contains an infinte series inside the integral.
3. Reading [40] is important for the context.
