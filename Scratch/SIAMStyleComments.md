## 2011 Halko Approximate Matrix Decomposition

1. It was cited by Lwmley in the 2018 Fast SKAT paper. So the journal is probably visible foir the genetics guys.

2. The paper is divided into three parts:
    - Part I: Introduction
    - Part II: Algorithms
    - Part III: Theory

3. The first part (intro) is divided into three sections: 
    - Overview
    - Related Work and Historical Context
    - Linear Algebraic Preliminaries

4. The latter section starts from the very basics: cannonical scalar product, norms... and builds up.

5. The second part contains a large number of algorithms (pseudocodes).

6. It contains as well 4 detailed numerical examples (applications).
